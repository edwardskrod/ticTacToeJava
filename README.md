ticTacToeJava
=============

This is a simple, command-line, Tic Tac Toe game I created in my fourth week of Java programming. The computer's AI is relatively smart but will not play to a tie in every game.  In other words, it is possible to beat the computer.

To use the program, simply download the .jar file. 

There are four ways to run the program:

1)  Human player vs Human Player

Open the Terminal, navigate to the directory in which the file resides and type:
  java -jar ticTacToe.jar
  
2)  Human as Player 1 vs Computer
  java -jar ticTacToe.jar -c 1

3)  Human as Player 2 vs Computer
  java -jar ticTacToe.jar -c 2
  
4) Computer vs Computer
java -jar ticTacToe.jar -c
