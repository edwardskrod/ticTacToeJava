 * PlayerComputer extends the abstract class Player
 * 
 *  Key differences:
 *  This class has a oponnentToken varible which stores the opposite toke.  
 *  This is used when checking for defensive moves in TicTacToeBoard.winningPosition(char token).
 * 
 * 
 * 	takeTurn() creates an automatic move that adheres to the following rules:
 * 1 - If a winning move is available, take it.
 * 2 - If the opponent is threatening a winning play, block it.
 *     Note that if the opponent has two winning plays, only one can be blocked).
 * 3 - If the center square is available, take it
 * 4 - Else choose randomly between any remaining squares
 * 
 *  generateRandomOpenPosition()  generates a random number between 1 - 9, checks to make sure
 *  it has not already been played, and plays it.
